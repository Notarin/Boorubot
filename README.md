# BOORUBOT
A bot designed to call random posts from booru image boards

# Info
the license of this bot requires that you document all changes to this bot you've made (i think GitHub does that for you) and keep the same license under the modified versions
as of around v4.0 i will switch to the unlicense

## Current features
the things i currently have implemented include:
* auto NSFW on NSFW channels
* pulls random post from danbooru.donmai.us
* pulls random post from yande.re
* pulls random post from konachan.com
* help command to see current features
* specify tags in search

## Planned features
the things i plan on including are:
* ~~append tags to specify ...tags~~
* push each command to another file (if that's possible)
* ~~comment code~~

## Features I'll never add
or at least any time soon...
* adding apis via discord
* adding sankaku complex
